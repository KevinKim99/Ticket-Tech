### 1. Team information and Team Agreement report.
- Team name: Create a name for your team.
    - Ticket-Tech
- Team members: List all the members of your team.
    - Erem Ozdemir (42987321)
    - Eric Smith (22222756)
    - Ken Anderson (60531845)
    - Nathan Worth (83995696)
    - Kevin Kim (13960737)
- Team agreement: The team agreement is a contract that all team members sign up to. It should detail the expectations each team has for its members:
    - Basic expectations
        - Send meeting updates Via text messenger Update more detailed information through discord. 
        - Respect for the work and respect for your team members
        - Meet each week during Lab 11, Fridays 8:00 am - 10:00 am
    -   Communication Channels:
        - Text message for meeting times and simple things 
        - Discord for more specific ideas, problems, questions and updates
        - For Urgent contact use the ‘@’ in discord to ping the group or a specific individual. If that doesn’t work send a message through text.
    - Code Quality and Style:
        - Commenting out your code, ensure that you say what your program/method/classes do.
        - Try your best to not upload incomplete code. Unless the code does run in functionality.
        - A few days before the hand in, review the code before going in for marking.
        - Create a readMe file within github and update the checklist within to ensure that everyone is aware of the changes that have been made
    - Task Ownership and Accountability:
        - Each individual holds equal responsibility for the project, thus not one person is to blame for a missing deadline. If proper communication has been taken.
        - Report to the group of your issues and inability to meet the deadline well in advance through text message.
        - Ultimately you are responsible for your own code and your own deadlines, however if you require help feel free to ask as this is a group project. We are only as strong as the weakest link. 
        - Ensure if you sense yourself or foresee yourself not being able to hit the deadlines please let the group know of this well in advance and we will create a plan to complete it before the deadline.
    -   Collaboration Tools:
        - Google Docs for simple ideas.
        - Discord allows for pasting code snippets.
        - Github for code.
        - Within github a Readme file with a checklist will be added and updated as the project moves along. This file will allow us to communicate what has all been done within the project. 
        - Organized file folders for test cases , source code, documentation, images, etc.
        - Avoid adding useless files into the file system.
        - Proper naming of branches. Use clear and simple branch names.
        - Clear and concise commit messages, [eg:“added user authentication”]
        - Ensure you are committing regularly, if you decide to leave the project for a few hours please commit changes. Even if the files aren’t complete. 
    - Availability and Time Commitment:
        - Each individual shall do an equal amount of work related to the project, if an individual is not doing their part, we may need to discuss future changes.
        - Ensure that you notify the group ahead of time (2 days) that you have alternative commitments and are unable to complete your part. Excluding sickness/ medical emergencies, Family issues, etc.
    - Testing and Quality Assurance:
        - Report bugs to the Readme file and state the issues with the bugs, also add the bug information into the discord that way we are aware of the issue on multiple platforms. Also do this for reporting and resolution of bugs.
        - Prioritize user-centric testing within the project as we are in the development stages we want to ensure that the basic principles of the program function.
        - Create fail testing to ensure that the code is able to combat negative test scenarios.
    - Deadline Adherence:
        - Ensure that you are planning ahead given Tests/exams and other projects in order to meet our desired milestones.
        - Communicate that you are having issues related to meeting the deadlines however it is on an individual to meet his/hers own goals.
    - Learning and Skill Development:
        - Ensure that each individual understands what the code does through commenting allowing other developers to understand and learn from your code.
        - If developers wish to develop some code in order to learn how to do it, allow them to take charge if they wish to, even if it is not their part of the project.
    - Conflict Resolution:
        - Communication is KEY. Most conflict will arise from lack of communication and/or exams and other project deadlines. 
        - If issues escalate, we may be required to discuss with the T/A, or the Professor in order to solve these issues. 
    - Feedback and Improvement:
        - Review of code must be done before handing in the project for Lab review. 
        - If you sense an issue or want to add constructive criticism or positive feedback to the project or someone’s code, specifically add it to the Readme file in their specific section.
        - Learn through reading other developers' code and reading their comments, ensure that you are able to understand each other's code and be able to explain their code if they aren’t there to describe it.
        - If certain things aren't working we want to ensure we improvise, Adapt and overcome these issues. 
    - Attendance and Punctuality:
        - We are expected to meet during the lab session, if plants change then ensure that everyone knows of the change of plans well in advance. Not the morning of or the night before anytime after 9:00 pm.
        - If a team member is consistently missing meetings we must all discuss why they are. if issues persist further ensure that we are documenting their missed sessions. Thus with documentation of said missing meeting we can show this to the lab T/A’s and professors.
- List the project's preference. We will try to accommodate you
    - Event Ticketing Platform
- List the Lab Section preference. We will try to accommodate you
    - L11 - Friday 8-10 am [sadly this is the only lab session everyone can attend]


### 2. Planning Framework
- Set up your team's GitHub repository. Your repo name should be your team's name.
- Add the URL of your repo in this submission (Canvas)
- Create a folder in the repo, called "Scrum meetings", and add all the templates for all the weeks. Fill the template for the first week after your team has the first scrum meeting.
- Create your product backlog and sprint backlog using the Kanban dashboard offered by GitHub.
