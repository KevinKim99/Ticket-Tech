# M3: Formal Analysis and Archetecture
## DUE March 08, 11:59pm

### For this milestone, use the appropriate models to present the details about what your system will look like, what it will do/be composed of, and what your architecture is. Submit a report containing the following information:

- You will need to have (at a high level) a diagram (it could be a box and stick diagram) describing the different components of the system (i.e., web server, database, broker, etc.) as well as talking about the purpose/function of each component in the system.  The reader should (at a high level), understand what is being built and what the different parts of the system are.
- You will need to model and analyze your use cases and requirements properly using the appropriate models with the appropriate level of granularity.  For the projects, at a minimum,  you will need to ensure that you have the appropriate sequence diagrams (supporting your use cases), as well as DFDs (you will need to have at least a level 0 and level 1).  
- You will also need to include a class diagram for the different parts of the system (this will help you to think about your testing).  The reader should be able to understand the different entities in the system (class diagram), how they interact with respect to time (sequence), and the data that is moving throughout the system (DFD).

### Rubric:

- Sequence diagrams (5 marks)
