# M3: Formal Analysis and Archetecture
## DUE March 08, 11:59pm

### For this milestone, use the appropriate models to present the details about what your system will look like, what it will do/be composed of, and what your architecture is. Submit a report containing the following information:

You will need to model and analyze your use cases and requirements properly using the appropriate models with the appropriate level of granularity.  For the projects, at a minimum, you will need to ensure that you have the appropriate sequence diagrams (for the two main use cases of your project), and you will also need to include a class diagram for the different parts of the system.
The reader should be able to understand the different entities in the system (class diagram), how they interact with respect to time (sequence), and the data that is moving throughout the system.
You will need to describe your test plan. That means, you should explain the current testing approaches your team is using and the future approaches your team will use. 
Describe at least two design patterns that will be implemented for your project. Clearly explain why your team has chosen those design patterns and how they will be implemented. You can add a class diagram for supporting your decision.

### Rubric:
